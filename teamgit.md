# Team Git Challenge

This challenge is meant to be a practice session in setting up a Team Git project. Your team will ultimately create a number of repositories equal to the number of members within the group.

1. For the first session, select a member of your group to be the Git Leader (Master). They will need to create a directory and name it: `[LastName]-TeamGit` (replacing "LastName" with their actual name).
   1. Within the directory, create an `index.html` document.
   2. Within the `index.html` document, create a simple `ul` that denotes each member of your group.
2. Save and push this project to GitHub.
   1. Add your group as collaborators to this project.
3. Once your group has all been added, they are to pull the project down and add their own html documents, naming them `[lastName]Page.html`.
   1. NOTE: Each member is to create their own working branch.
   2. Add some content (it doesn't matter what this is) and have the respected `li` item hyperlink (`anchor tags`) to the associated members page.
   3. Each member is to push their code up to their respective branch.
4. The Git Leader will work through the pull requests and update the `Main Branch`.

# After the First Session

Once this has been completed the first time, do this again but have another member of the team lead the process. Repeat this process until all members of the team have had an opportunity to lead a practice session.

# After All Members Have Led

Select one (or all if your group wants more practice) of the sessions and have each member update an html document that they did not create.
ex: Sue will now add content to Bob's created page. Bob will update Jill's and Jill will update Sue's.

Be sure to communicate well with your team throughout this process.

# Getting Stuck

There are a couple of options that your team can do with getting stuck and it depends on the depth of what that problem is. Review the documentation that was provided in the Team Git walkthrough. Research how you might correct a commit or how to pull down code from the overall project.

If all else fails, there's nothing wrong in simply deleting the repository and trying all over again. This is meant to a practice after all and expected to delete this after all is said and done.
Note: If you delete the repo in GitHub, don't forget to delete your `git folder` within your workstation or reset your origin so that it is linked to the correct GitHub repository.
